Welcome to the Titanic Survival EDA and Prediction Model repository! This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) techniques.

## Project Overview

Explore the Titanic dataset to understand factors influencing survival using EDA techniques like:
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses
- Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## Machine Learning Models

Evaluate various ML algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## Main Libraries and Tools

Utilize Python libraries:
- `numpy`, `pandas` for data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` for ML modeling
- Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis (`Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`)
